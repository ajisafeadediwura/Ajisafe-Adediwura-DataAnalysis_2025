Data processing and data cleaning are indispensable steps in the process of data analysis, which can enhance data quality and provide reliable basis for subsequent analysis and decision-making.
Data processing: It refers to a series of operations such as collection, organization, transformation and analysis of raw data, aiming to extract valuable information.
Data cleaning: The main task is to identify and handle issues such as errors, missing values, duplicate values, and outliers in the data, ensuring the accuracy, completeness and consistency of the data.
Introduction:
1. Loading necessary libraries
libraries <- c("dplyr", "skimr", "visdat", "naniar", "mice", "ggplot2", "dbscan", "FactoMineR", "factoextra")
for (lib in libraries) {
  if (!require(lib, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(lib)
    library(lib, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}
This part of the code creates a vector containing the names of multiple R packages, and then checks whether each package is installed and loaded through a loop. If it is not installed, it will be automatically installed and loaded; if it is installed, it will be directly loaded. These packages are used for subsequent data operations, visualizations, missing value processing, and other tasks.
2. Data reading and basic information viewing
data_path <- "DataSet_No_Details.csv"
df <- read.csv(data_path)
str(df)
skim(df) 
Specify the dataset file path and read the CSV file into the data frame df. str(df) is used to view the structure of the data frame, understand the data types and general content of each column; skim(df) provides a detailed summary of the data, such as the distribution of numerical variables.
3. Dataset preparation
cols_to_remove <- c("h_index_34", "h_index_56", "hormone10_1", "hormone10_2", "an_index_23", "outcome", "factor_eth", "factor_h", "factor_pcos", "factor_prl")
MD_df <- df %>% select(-any_of(cols_to_remove))
factor_df <- df %>% select(record_id, outcome, factor_eth, factor_h, factor_pcos, factor_prl)
str(MD_df)
summary(factor_df)
Define a vector of column names to be removed from the original data frame df, and use the select function of the dplyr package to remove these columns to obtain MD-df. At the same time, extract some columns to create factor-df. Then view the structure of MD_df and the summary information of factor-df again.
4. Missing value identification and analysis
total_na <- sum(is.na(MD_df))               
col_na_counts <- colSums(is.na(MD_df))           
skim(MD_df)
na_stats <- colMeans(is.na(MD_df)) * 100 
na_stats_filtered <- na_stats[na_stats <= 35] 
na_stats_filtered_table <- data.frame(
  Column = names(na_stats_filtered),
  NA_Percent = na_stats_filtered,
  row.names = NULL
)
na_stats_filtered_1 <- na_stats[na_stats > 35] 
na_stats_filtered_1_table <- data.frame(
  Column = names(na_stats_filtered_1),
  NA_Percent = na_stats_filtered_1,
  row.names = NULL
)
vis_miss(MD_df)
gg_miss_var(MD_df)
Calculate the total number of missing values in MD-df, the number of missing values in each column, and the percentage of missing values in each column. Filter the columns with a missing value percentage not exceeding 35% and those exceeding 35% according to the percentage of missing values, and organize them into data frames respectively. Use the vis-miss and gg-miss-var functions to visualize the patterns of missing data.
5. Missing data processing and MCAR test
cols_to_remove1 <- c("hormone9", "hormone11", "hormone12", "hormone13", "hormone14")
handle_MD_df <- MD_df %>% select(-any_of(cols_to_remove1))
handle_MD_df_clean <- handle_MD_df %>%
  select(where(~!all(is.na(.)))) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
mcar_result <- mcar_test(handle_MD_df_clean)
print(mcar_result)
interpret_mcar <- function(mcar_result) {
  p <- mcar_result$p.value
  if (p > 0.05) {
    message("✅ p-value > 0.05 → Data is likely MCAR. Safe to delete or impute.")
  } else {
    message("❗ p-value <= 0.05 → Data is NOT MCAR. Assume MAR or MNAR.")
    message("➡️ It is recommended to use the multiple imputation (mice) method, such as pmm / rf, etc.")
  }
}
interpret_mcar(mcar_result)
Remove more columns with a large number of missing values to obtain handle-MD-df, and further process it to get handle-MD-df-clean, removing columns that are all missing values and converting character variables into factor variables. Perform the Little's MCAR test, judge whether the data is Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) according to the test results, and give corresponding processing suggestions.
6. Multiple imputation
imputed_pmm <- mice(handle_MD_df[,!names(handle_MD_df) %in% "New"], method = "pmm")
imputed_pmm_final <- complete(imputed_pmm)
imputed_rf <- mice(handle_MD_df[,!names(handle_MD_df) %in% "New"], method = "rf")
imputed_rf_final <- complete(imputed_rf)
Use the mice package to perform multiple imputations on the processed data using the Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) and Random Forest (RF) methods respectively, and obtain the complete imputed datasets.
7. Comparison of imputation effects
compare_density <- function(var, original_data, pmm_data, rf_data) {
  # Function content omitted
}
vars_to_plot <- handle_MD_df %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  select(where(~ any(is.na(.)))) %>%
  names()
for (v in vars_to_plot) {
  plot <- compare_density(v, handle_MD_df, imputed_pmm_final, imputed_rf_final)
  print(plot)
  ggsave(filename = paste0("Users/haoshilong/Desktop/Graphs/imputation_density_", v, ".png"), 
         plot = plot, width = 6, height = 4)
}
Define a function compare-density to compare the density distributions of the original data and the data obtained by two imputation methods. Extract the names of numerical variables with missing values, draw density comparison plots for each variable, and save them to the specified path.
8. Outlier detection
# Select specific columns and reshape the data for outlier detection
outliers_data <- imputed_rf_final %>%
  select(lipids1, lipids2, lipids3, lipids4, lipids5) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")
# Generate boxplots to detect outliers
boxplot1 <- ggplot(outliers_data, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Outlier Detection",
       x = "variables",
       y = "value") +
  theme_minimal()
print(boxplot1)
ggsave(filename = "Users/haoshilong/Desktop/Graphs/outlier_detection_boxplot.png", 
       plot = boxplot1, width = 6, height = 4)
# Generate boxplots for all numerical variables to detect outliers
boxplot2 <- imputed_rf_final %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots for Outlier Detection")
print(boxplot2)
ggsave(filename = "Users/haoshilong/Desktop/Graphs/all_numeric_outlier_boxplot.png", 
       plot = boxplot2, width = 8, height = 6)
# Calculate LOF factors
lof_data <- imputed_rf_final %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  na.omit()
lof_scores <- lof(lof_data, k = 20)
lof_df <- lof_data %>%
  mutate(lof_score = lof_scores)
# Visualize LOF factors
# Histogram
lof_hist <- ggplot(lof_df, aes(x = lof_score)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 0.05,
    fill = "#FF7F00",
    color = "black",
    alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of  LOF Scores",
    x = "LOF Score",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
print(lof_hist)
ggsave(filename = "Users/haoshilong/Desktop/Graphs/lof_histogram.png", 
       plot = lof_hist, width = 6, height = 4)
# Scatter plot (show the distribution of LOF scores using lipids1 and lipids2 as an example)
lof_scatter <- ggplot(lof
Analyze the interpolated data by using box plots and the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to detect outliers. Draw different types of box plots, calculate LOF scores, visualize the LOF scores through histograms and scatter plots, determine outliers based on the LOF scores and highlight them, and finally save all relevant graphics to the designated path.
